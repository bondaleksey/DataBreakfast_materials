    "Branches makes it super easy to work within self-contained contexts, but often we want to incorporate changes from one branch to another!\n",
    "\n",
    "We can do this using the `git merge` command \n",

    "**We merge branches, not specific commits**\n",
    "**We always merge to the current HEAD branch**\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "To merge, follow these basic steps:\n",
    "1. Switch to or checkout the branch you want to merge the changes into (the receiving branch)\n",
    "2. Use the `git merge` command to merge changes from specific branch into the current branch\n",
    "`git switch master`\n",
    "`git merge bugfix`\n",
