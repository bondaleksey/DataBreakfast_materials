    "\n",
    "#### 2.1 Repeat about add and commit\n",
    "Each file in your working directory can be in one of two states: untracked or tracked (unmodified, modified, or staged).\n",
    "[states of files](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Basics-Recording-Changes-to-the-Repository)\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2.2 About Branches\n",
    "\n",
    "[git book](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Branching-Branches-in-a-Nutshell)\n",
    "\n",
    "On large project, we often work in multiple contexts:\n",
    "\n",
    "- 2 different color scheme,\n",
    "- trying to fix a horrible bug, \n",
    "- adding a new chat widget,\n",
    "- updating the search bar autocomplete, \n",
    "- an experimental radical design of the entire layout.\n",
    "\n",
    "**If we make changes on one branch, they do not impact the other branches (unless we merge the changes)**\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2.3 Many people designate the main (master) branch as their 'source of truth' or the 'official branch' for their codebase, but that is left to you to decide.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2.4 HEAD -> main (master)\n",
    "HEAD is simply a pointer that refers to the current 'location' in your repository.\n",
    "It points to a particular branch reference (where a branch currently is).\n",
    "\n",
    "HEAD always points to the latest commit you made on the main (master) branch, but HEAD can change!\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2.5 `ANALOGY`\n",
    "You can think of branches as bookmarks in the book in which we write. \n",
    "We can have a whole bunch of different bookmarks in different places in a book (where we want to work).\n",
    "At any given point in time, only one of those spots can be open.\n",
    "We can't have the book open to multiple pages. \n",
    "So only one is active.\n",
    "Only one is being read or viewed.\n",
    "It's actually open to that bookmark.\n",
    "So that is what HEAD refers to.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2.6 Commands:\n",
    "- [`git branch`](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-branch) \n",
    "    - `git branch` -> to view your existing branches,\n",
    "    - `git branch <branch-name>` -> to make a new branch (based upon the current HEAD), but not switch to it\n",
    "    - `git branch -m <branch-name>` -> rename a branch\n",
    "    - `git branch -d <branch-name>` -> delete a branch \n",
    "- [`git switch`](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-switch)\n",
    "    - `git switch <branch-name>` -> to switch to other branch \n",
    "    - `git switch -c <branch-name>` -> to create a new branch AND switch to it all in one go. (Remember -c as short for \"create\")\n",
    "- [`git checkout`]()\n",
    "    - [`git checkout <branch-name>`] -> historically, used to switch branches\n",
    "    - [`git checkout -b <branch-name>`] -> to create a new branch AND switch to it all in one go. \n",
    "\n",
